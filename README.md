# Rainbooh
run "yarn migrate && yarn up && yarn dev" in the Rainbooh-server folder to create the migrations, migrate the databases and start the server.
run "yarn dev" in the Rainbooh-web folder to start the app

Then browse to localhost:4000/graphql to access the graphq server
Or browse to localhost:3000/ to access the application

Tested on Chrome and Firefox, doesn't work
Works on Edge and VSC's simple browser though

So that's something.
